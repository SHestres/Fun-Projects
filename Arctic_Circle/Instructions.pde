Hello! This is an implimentation of the "Arctic Circle Theorem" from this youtube video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7Q8IWNfHM
If you want, read the controls, hit play, and enjoy fun visuals! I would also highly reccomend watching the
video to understand what's going on. (The video even goes through an algoritim similar to what I used here)
Hopefully you enjoy!

P - progress the simulation to a larger grid
C - change the background color
S - toggle the shape of the grid between fill and square
R - reset with new random order 1 grid
N - next grid (step by 1 order)
T - toggle tile look

In code tiles are broken into two squares that are the left/right or top/bottom part 
of that tile. Each square is also differentiated by the direction it's tile is facing
  1 - left facing top tile
  2 - up facing left tile
  3 - right facing top tile
  4 - down facing left tile
  
  6 - left facing bottom tile
  7 - up facing right tile
  8 - right facing bottom tile
  9 - down facing right tile
